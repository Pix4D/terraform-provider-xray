# xray_licenses_report (Resource)

Creates Xray License Due Diligence report. The License Due Diligence report provides you with a list of components and artifacts and their relevant licenses. This enables you to review and verify that the components and artifacts comply with the license requirements. This report provides due diligence license related information on each component for a selected scope. Due diligence license information includes information such as unknown licenses and unrecognized licenses found in your components.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "xray_licenses_report" "report" {
  name = "test-license-report"

  resources {
    repository {
      name                  = "reponame"
      include_path_patterns = ["pattern1", "pattern2"]
      exclude_path_patterns = ["pattern2", "pattern2"]
    }

    repository {
      name                  = "reponame1"
      include_path_patterns = ["pattern1", "pattern2"]
      exclude_path_patterns = ["pattern1", "pattern2"]
    }
  }

  filters {
    component     = "component-name"
    artifact      = "impacted-artifact"
    unknown       = false
    unrecognized  = true
    license_names = ["Apache", "MIT"]

    scan_date {
      start = "2020-06-29T12:22:16Z"
      end   = "2020-07-29T12:22:16Z"
    }
