# xray_violations_report (Resource)

Creates Xray Violations report. The Violations report provides you with information on security and license violations for each component in the selected scope. Violations information includes information such as type of violation, impacted artifacts, and severity.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "xray_violations_report" "report" {
  name = "test-violations-report"

  resources {
    repository {
      name                  = "reponame"
      include_path_patterns = ["pattern1", "pattern2"]
      exclude_path_patterns = ["pattern2", "pattern2"]
    }

    repository {
      name                  = "reponame1"
      include_path_patterns = ["pattern1", "pattern2"]
      exclude_path_patterns = ["pattern1", "pattern2"]
    }
  }

  filters {
    type           = "security"
    watch_names    = ["NameOfWatch1", "NameOfWatch2"]
    component      = "*vulnerable:component*"
    artifact       = "some://impacted*artifact"
    policy_names   = ["policy1", "policy2"]
    severities     = ["High", "Medium"]

    updated {
      start = "2020-06-29T12:22:16Z"
      end   = "2020-07-29T12:22:16Z"
    }

    security_filters {
      issue_id = "XRAY-87343"
      summary_contains = "kernel"
      has_remediation  = true

      cvss_score {
        min_score = 6.3
        max_score = 9
      }
    }

    license_filters {
      unknown       = false
      unrecognized  = true
      license_names = ["Apache", "MIT"]
    }
  }
